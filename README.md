## About the Game

The Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle is a famous problem in artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. It challenges players to think strategically about state transitions and constraint satisfaction.

### The Challenge

You need to transport 3 missionaries and 3 cannibals across a river using a boat that can carry at most 2 people at a time. The catch? If cannibals ever outnumber missionaries on either side of the river, the missionaries will be eaten!

### Rules

1. **Boat Capacity**: The boat can carry 1 or 2 people at a time
2. **Safety Constraint**: Missionaries must never be outnumbered by cannibals on either side
3. **Boat Operation**: Someone must always row the boat back and forth
4. **Win Condition**: Get all 6 people safely to the other side

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click to select passengers and move the boat
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear representation of both sides of the river
- **Move Validation**: The game prevents invalid moves that would violate the rules
- **Win Detection**: Celebrates when you successfully solve the puzzle
- **Reset Functionality**: Start over anytime to try different strategies
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Play

1. **Select Passengers**: Click on the missionaries (M) and/or cannibals (C) on the current side of the boat
2. **Move the Boat**: Click the boat or move button to transport selected passengers
3. **Plan Ahead**: Think carefully about each move to avoid dangerous situations
4. **Complete the Puzzle**: Get everyone safely across the river

## Strategy Tips

- Always ensure missionaries are not outnumbered on either side
- Sometimes you need to send people back to make progress
- The puzzle requires exactly 11 moves to solve optimally
- Think about the state after each move, not just the current move

## The Classic Solution

While we won't spoil the fun, this puzzle has a well-known optimal solution that requires careful planning and strategic thinking. The key is understanding that sometimes you must temporarily move people back to the starting side to achieve the final goal.

## Educational Value

This puzzle is excellent for:
- **Logic Development**: Enhances strategic thinking and planning skills
- **Computer Science**: Demonstrates state-space search problems
- **Problem Solving**: Teaches constraint satisfaction and goal-oriented thinking
- **Cognitive Science**: Classic example used in psychology research
